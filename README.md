# FHE-Sentiment-Analysis

### Introduction
In this paper, we demonstrate a way of performing privacy-preserving sentiment analysis using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Sentiment analysis is a machine learning technique that extracts subjective information from textual data. As such, sentiment anal- ysis can be performed on customer reviews, emails, and more to extract and analyze sentiment information of said data. Although a powerful tool, sentiment analysis in its current form, like other machine learning models, requires transparency and availability of data. This means that in industries and fields where data privacy is paramount, they cannot rely on third-party supercomputers or cloud architectures to perform sentiment analysis. This is where FHE comes in. FHE, as proven and demonstrated by Craig Gen- try in 2009, allows for computation on encrypted data without the need for decrypting it first [Gentry 2009]. In other words, sentiment analysis performed with FHE will ensure data privacy even if the sentiment analysis computations are being performed by untrusted third parties.
